# Project-Rock-Paper-Scissor
A class project from The Odin Project course to implement all Javascript´s lessons I've been learning

## What is the aim of this project?
To make a simple implementation of grade-school classic “rock paper scissors”. For the moment I'm just going to build it up to get to play the game from the browser console, but I will revisit this project in a later lesson and add a Graphical User Interface with buttons and text.

## Feedback messages 🎁
I welcome any feedback you can give me on my project, on the form and content of this readme.md, or on my commits.
